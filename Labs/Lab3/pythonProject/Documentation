add_element:
        Method for adding an element to the subtree with root element
        element: Element, root of the subtree in which the new entry is to be added
        name: String, the new entry to be added
        Worst case: O(log2n)

min_value_element:
        Method that returns the element with the minimum value in the subtree with root element
        element: Element, root of the subtree in which the search is started

remove_element:
        Method for removing an element from the subtree with root root
        root: Element, root of the subtree from which the entry is to be removed
        name: String, the element to be removed
        Worst case: O(h), h-height of the binary tree

print_elements:
        Method for printing all elements in the main binary tree

inorder_traversal:
        Method for printing the subtree with root root in inorder traversal
        root: Element, root of the subtree that is to be printed

search:
        Method for searching an element in the subtree with root root
        root: Element, root of the subtree in which the entry is searched
        name: String, the entry to be searched
        Worst case: O(log2n)
